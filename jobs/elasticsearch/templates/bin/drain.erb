# This script keeps the elasticsearch cluster stable when BOSH needs to manage
# nodes during deploys. This is simplistic and only accounts for serial
# changes to the elasticsearch nodes, so be sure elasticsearch jobs are
# configured to deploy serially.
#
# When you get into fancier cluster scenarios, you'll want to disable this with
# the `elasticsearch.drain: false` property and manage your own cluster
# settings.
